# Resource Bloc

A specialized Bloc for managing data backed by both local and remote sources.

This package helps simplify offline-first data loading patterns. Whereas a normal Bloc is typically used to manage a single feature, a Resource Bloc is typically used to manage a single *resource* that exists on a remote server but can be saved in a local database on the client.

Inspired by [Kotlin Store](https://github.com/dropbox/Store) and the [NetworkBoundResource](https://github.com/android/architecture-components-samples/blob/88747993139224a4bb6dbe985adf652d557de621/GithubBrowserSample/app/src/main/java/com/android/example/github/repository/NetworkBoundResource.kt) pattern in the [Android App Architecture guide](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide), but with the semantics of the BLoC design pattern.

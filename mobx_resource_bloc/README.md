The main `ComputedResourceBloc` class works similarly to a `Computed` 
object in MobX. 

The `key` of the resource bloc will automatically be updated 
whenever any observed MobX values change. The properties of the bloc such
as its `state`, `key`, `value`, and `stream` are also observable values
and will update any subscribed MobX reactions when they change.
